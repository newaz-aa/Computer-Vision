## Outline

These notebooks cover CNN model design from basic to advanced using TensorFlow. Topics that are covered in each notebook are as follows -

* Basic CNN architecture design -- Dropout Regularization -- Batch Normalization
* CNN with Callbacks
* Using Pre-trained CNN architecture for prediction
* Working on real-world datasets -- Data augmentation - how to prepare data in Kaggle
* Transfer Learning
* Hand-drawn Electric circuit Schematic Components prediction - how to prepare data in Google Colab
* Practical example: Malaria parasite detection from blood smears using CNNs
* Object Detection
* U-Net
